## System Prerequisites

- Node.js >= v18.x (tested with Node 22.x)
- NPM (comes bundled with Node.js)
- Git

---

## Initial Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/playwright-demo-framework-bdd.git
cd playwright-demo-framework-bdd
```

### Install Project Dependencies 

```bash
npm install
```

### Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
npm run install:browsers
```

---

## How to Run the Tests

### Run all scenarios:

```bash
npm test
```

### Run specific scenario by tag:

```bash
npm test -- --tags "@successful"
npm test -- --tags "@invalid"
```

### Headless Mode (default is headless: true)

Modify in `src/support/hooks.ts`:

```typescript
browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
```

---

### Run with Visual Debugging + Specific Tags

To run a specific tag with the browser visible:
```bash
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium -- --tags "@tagname"
```

---

### üß™ Run Tests

Choose the appropriate command based on your testing and reporting needs.

```bash
npm test
```
‚úÖ Runs all tests in **headless mode** and outputs a simple result summary to the terminal.  
‚ùå Does not upload results or screenshots.

```bash
npm run test:with-report
```
‚úÖ Runs all tests headlessly, then **automatically uploads results** to TestRail and screenshots to ImgBB (if configured).  
üü¢ Best for CI pipelines or automated reporting environments.

```bash
npm run test:headed:with-report
```
‚úÖ Runs all tests in **headed mode** (visible browser), with TestRail + ImgBB integration.  
üõ†Ô∏è Ideal for debugging failing scenarios while still reporting the results.

## Output Artifacts

### Screenshots:

- Saved to: `/screenshots/`

### Selectors as Constants
All page selectors are defined in files under:
```
src/constants/selectors/
```

Example:  
- `login.selectors.ts`: Contains locators for login page
- `dashboard.selectors.ts`: Contains locators for post-login area

This improves test maintainability by avoiding hardcoded selectors.

### Traces (only for failed scenarios):

- Saved to: `/traces/`

### View traces:

```bash
npx playwright show-trace traces/<scenario-name>.zip
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Guide (TestRail + ImgBB + Environment)

### 1. üß™ TestRail Setup

1. Create an account on [TestRail](https://www.gurock.com/testrail/) and log into your workspace.
2. Enable the API under `Administration > Site Settings > API > Enable API`.
3. Create a new 'Project' and inside it a 'Test Suite'.
4. Navigate to the project and copy the `project_id` and `suite_id` from the URL.
5. Create at least one test case (e.g., "Successful login") and copy its ID (`Cxxxx`).
6. Tag your Cucumber scenario with `@Cxxxx`.

### 2. üñºÔ∏è ImgBB Setup

1. Create a free account at [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com).
2. Go to [ImgBB API Key](https://api.imgbb.com/) and copy your personal API Key.
3. This API allows uploading images and instantly getting a public link.

### 3. üîê Environment Variables (`.env`)

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the following variables:

```
TESTRAIL_HOST=https://<your-subdomain>.testrail.io
TESTRAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
TESTRAIL_API_KEY=your-api-key
TESTRAIL_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
TESTRAIL_SUITE_ID=your_suite_id
IMGBB_API_KEY=your-imgbb-api-key
```

This file is included in `.gitignore` for security.

### 4. üí° Tips & Tricks

- You can manually test your ImgBB key using `curl`:
  ```bash
  curl -F "image=@screenshot.png" -F "key=YOUR_KEY" https://api.imgbb.com/1/upload
  ```
- If you don‚Äôt add the `IMGBB_API_KEY`, the framework will still work, but the TestRail comments will show a local fallback link instead of a public image.
- Use `npm run test:with-report` to run the tests and automatically upload the results to TestRail.

### 5. üåê Base URL & Credentials Setup
To allow flexible configuration and testing across environments, the login page dynamically loads values from `.env`.

Add these variables to your `.env` file:
```
BASE_URL=https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/
TEST_EMAIL=your-valid-email@example.com
TEST_PASSWORD=your-valid-password
INVALID_EMAIL=wrong@domain.com
INVALID_PASSWORD=wrongpassword
```

These will be used automatically during tests for valid and invalid login scenarios.

## TestRail Integration (Automatic Test Run Upload)

### ‚úÖ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root with the following:

```
TESTRAIL_HOST=https://<your-subdomain>.testrail.io
TESTRAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
TESTRAIL_API_KEY=your-api-key
TESTRAIL_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
TESTRAIL_SUITE_ID=your_suite_id
IMGBB_API_KEY=your-imgbb-api-key
```

### üß© Dependencies

Make sure these are installed:

```bash
npm install dotenv ts-node axios
```

### üß™ Run your Cucumber tests to generate the report:

```bash
npm test
```

### üè∑Ô∏è Tag each scenario with its corresponding TestRail Case ID:

```gherkin
@C2331
Scenario: Successful login
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Upload results to TestRail:

```bash
npx ts-node src/reporting/testrail-reporter.ts
```

### üì∏ Public Screenshot Upload

After each test run, the framework automatically uploads screenshots to [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com) and includes public URLs in TestRail comments.

‚úÖ When using ImgBB, screenshots are uploaded to a public URL and work regardless of CI environment.

> üîí Fallback screenshot links will reference Jenkins if running in CI and no `IMGBB_API_KEY` is set.

Make sure to add your `IMGBB_API_KEY` to the `.env` file to enable this feature.

### üßµ One-liner command:

```bash
npm test && npx ts-node src/reporting/testrail-reporter.ts
```

---

### üõ† Jenkins Integration (Optional)

You can run your tests automatically in Jenkins using a freestyle or pipeline job. 

#### Prerequisites:
- Jenkins installed and accessible
- Git and Node.js installed on the Jenkins agent
- Environment variables configured in Jenkins or passed from a `.env` file

#### Example Steps for Jenkins Pipeline:
```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
    TESTRAIL_HOST = 'https://your-subdomain.testrail.io'
    TESTRAIL_USER = 'your-email@example.com'
    TESTRAIL_API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
    TESTRAIL_PROJECT_ID = 'your_project_id'
    TESTRAIL_SUITE_ID = 'your_suite_id'
    IMGBB_API_KEY = 'your-imgbb-api-key'
  }
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git 'https://github.com/<your-github-username>/playwright-demo-framework-bdd.git'
      }
    }
    stage('Install Dependencies') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm install'
        sh 'npm run install:browsers'
      }
    }
    stage('Run Tests') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm run test:with-report'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> ‚úÖ Jenkins automatically stores screenshots as artifacts under `/screenshots`. Public visibility requires Jenkins to be accessible via internet or VPN.

> üñºÔ∏è For guaranteed screenshot visibility in TestRail, ImgBB is preferred.

üîÅ **If you're not using ImgBB**, ensure Jenkins is publicly accessible (e.g., via a custom domain, VPN, or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)) to allow TestRail to render screenshot links properly.

> üí° **Note:** Jenkins screenshots are only visible in TestRail if Jenkins is reachable from the public web. Otherwise, prefer using ImgBB for reliable public URLs.

## ‚úÖ GitHub Actions Checks

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically run tests on each push and pull request. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

### ‚úÖ Required for Merge

Pull requests cannot be merged into `main` unless the GitHub Actions check (`Playwright Tests`) completes successfully. This ensures that all contributions meet the minimum stability and functionality requirements before being integrated into the main branch.
